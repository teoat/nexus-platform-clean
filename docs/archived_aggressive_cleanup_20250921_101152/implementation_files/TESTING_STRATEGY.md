# Project Nexus Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Project Nexus, ensuring high quality, reliability, and maintainability across all components.

## 1. Principles

- **Shift Left:** Integrate testing early in the development lifecycle.
- **Automate Everything:** Prioritize automated tests over manual testing where feasible.
- **Layered Approach:** Utilize different types of tests (unit, integration, E2E) to cover various aspects of the system.
- **Fast Feedback:** Ensure tests run quickly to provide rapid feedback to developers.
- **Traceability:** Link tests to requirements and defects.

## 2. Test Types

### 2.1 Unit Tests

- **Purpose:** Verify the smallest testable parts of an application (functions, methods, classes) in isolation.
- **Scope:** Individual components, without external dependencies (mocked).
- **Location:** Alongside the code they test (e.g., `nexus_backend/module/test_module.py`, `nexus_backend/nexus_frontend/components/component.test.js`).
- **Frameworks:** [Specify frameworks, e.g., Pytest for Python, Jest/React Testing Library for Frontend]
- **Execution:** Run automatically on every commit/PR.

### 2.2 Integration Tests

- **Purpose:** Verify the interactions between different units or components, including interactions with external services (databases, APIs).
- **Scope:** Modules, services, or microservices interacting with each other or with controlled external dependencies.
- **Location:** `tests/integration/`
- **Frameworks:** [Specify frameworks, e.g., Pytest with test doubles, Supertest for API testing]
- **Execution:** Run on every commit/PR, typically after unit tests.

### 2.3 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Purpose:** Simulate real user scenarios to verify the entire application flow from start to finish, including the UI, backend, and database.
- **Scope:** Full application stack, deployed in a test environment.
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/`
- **Frameworks:** [Specify frameworks, e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium]
- **Execution:** Run on every commit/PR, and before deployment to staging/production.

### 2.4 Performance Tests

- **Purpose:** Assess the system's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions.
- **Scope:** Critical API endpoints, high-traffic user journeys.
- **Tools:** [Specify tools, e.g., Locust, JMeter, k6]
- **Execution:** Periodically, or before major releases.

### 2.5 Security Tests

- **Purpose:** Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's security posture.
- **Scope:** Application code, dependencies, infrastructure.
- **Tools:** SAST, DAST, Dependency Scanners (e.g., Snyk, Trivy).
- **Execution:** Integrated into CI/CD, periodically, or during security audits.

## 3. Test Data Management

- **Strategy:** [Describe how test data is created, managed, and cleaned up for different test types (e.g., factories, fixtures, database seeding)].

## 4. Test Environment

- **Description:** [Describe the dedicated test environments for integration and E2E tests, ensuring isolation and consistency].

## 5. Test Coverage

- **Goal:** [Specify target test coverage percentages for unit, integration tests].
- **Tooling:** [Specify coverage tools, e.g., `pytest-cov`, `Istanbul/nyc`].
- **Reporting:** Coverage reports are generated and integrated into CI/CD.

## 6. CI/CD Integration

All automated tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and must pass before code can be merged to `main` or deployed.

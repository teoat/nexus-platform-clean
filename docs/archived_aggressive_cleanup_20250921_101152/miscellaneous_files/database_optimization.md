# Project Nexus Database Optimization Guidelines

This document outlines guidelines and best practices for optimizing database performance within Project Nexus. Efficient database operations are critical for the overall responsiveness and scalability of the application.

## 1. Principles

- **Index Wisely:** Use indexes to speed up data retrieval, but be mindful of their overhead on writes.
- **Query Optimization:** Write efficient queries that minimize resource consumption.
- **Schema Design:** Design a normalized and efficient database schema.
- **Monitor Continuously:** Regularly monitor database performance to identify and address bottlenecks proactively.

## 2. Schema Design Best Practices

- **Normalization:** Aim for appropriate normalization levels to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Denormalize strategically for read performance where justified.
- **Data Types:** Use the most appropriate and smallest data types for columns (e.g., `SMALLINT` instead of `INT` if values are small).
- **Primary Keys:** Always define primary keys for tables.
- **Foreign Keys:** Use foreign keys to enforce referential integrity and improve query optimizer hints.
- **Avoid NULLs:** Minimize nullable columns where possible, as they can complicate indexing and queries.

## 3. Indexing Strategies

- **Identify Candidates:** Index columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, `ORDER BY` clauses, and `GROUP BY` clauses.
- **Composite Indexes:** Create composite indexes for queries involving multiple columns.
- **Index Selectivity:** Ensure indexes are selective (i.e., they narrow down the result set significantly).
- **Avoid Over-indexing:** Too many indexes can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and consume excessive disk space.
- **Partial/Conditional Indexes:** Use for specific subsets of data (e.g., `WHERE status = 'active'`).
- **Covering Indexes:** Create indexes that include all columns needed by a query, allowing the database to retrieve data directly from the index without accessing the table.

## 4. Query Optimization

- **`EXPLAIN` / `ANALYZE`:** Always use the database's `EXPLAIN` (or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) command to understand query execution plans and identify bottlenecks.
- **Avoid `SELECT *`:** Explicitly list columns needed to reduce network traffic and memory usage.
- **Minimize Subqueries:** Often, `JOIN` operations are more efficient than subqueries.
- **`JOIN` Optimization:** Ensure `JOIN` conditions use indexed columns. Choose appropriate `JOIN` types.
- **`WHERE` Clause Efficiency:** Place the most restrictive conditions first. Avoid functions on indexed columns in `WHERE` clauses.
- **Pagination:** Implement efficient pagination using `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` on indexed columns.
- **Batch Operations:** Use `INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...);` or `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (...);` for multiple records instead of individual statements.
- **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing new database connections for each request.

## 5. Database Configuration

- **Memory Allocation:** Configure database memory parameters (e.g., `shared_buffers`, `work_mem` for PostgreSQL) appropriately based on available RAM.
- **Disk I/O:** Optimize disk I/O settings, consider faster storage (SSD) or RAID configurations.
- **Connection Limits:** Set appropriate maximum connection limits.

## 6. ORM Usage (if applicable)

- **N+1 Query Problem:** Be aware of and actively prevent the N+1 query problem by using eager loading (e.g., `select_related`, `prefetch_related` in Django ORM; `joinedload` in SQLAlchemy).
- **Batch Operations:** Utilize ORM features for batch inserts/updates/deletes.
- **Raw SQL:** Don't hesitate to use raw SQL for complex or highly performance-critical queries that ORM cannot optimize effectively.

## 7. Monitoring

- **Slow Query Logs:** Enable and regularly review slow query logs to identify problematic queries.
- **Database Metrics:** Monitor key database metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, active connections, cache hit ratio, query throughput, latency) using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

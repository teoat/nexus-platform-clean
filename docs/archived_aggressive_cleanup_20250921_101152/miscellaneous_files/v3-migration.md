   python nexus_backend/automation/enhanced_collaborative_automation_v3.py
   ```

5. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check system metrics
   - Verify task completion
   - Monitor AI optimization

## Configuration

### Worker Configuration

```python
# V3 worker settings
self.max_workers = 120  # Increased capacity
self.min_workers = 10   # Increased minimum
self.swarm_workers = 50  # Enhanced swarm capacity
```

### AI Settings

```python
# AI optimization settings
self.settings.ai_learning_rate = 0.01
self.settings.ml_prediction_confidence = 0.8
self.settings.optimization_frequency = 30
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Install missing dependencies
2. **Memory Issues**: Adjust worker limits
3. **Performance Issues**: Check AI settings

### Support

- Check logs: logs/automation/enhanced_collaborative_automation_v3.log
- Review documentation: docs/automation/
- Contact team for assistance

- Generate reports on development velocity
- Identify bottlenecks and resource needs

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the development plan
2. Assign team members to specific phases
3. Set up project management tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)
4. Begin Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
5. Monitor automation system progress

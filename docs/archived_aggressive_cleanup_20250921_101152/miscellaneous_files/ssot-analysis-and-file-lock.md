- **Action**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- **Impact**: Early detection of issues and improved system reliability
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Timeline**: 3-5 days

### 5. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix Missing Dependencies

- **Description**: Dependency issues identified
- **Action**: Resolve all missing file dependencies and implement dependency validation
- **Impact**: Ensures proper system operation and prevents cascading failures
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days

## üéØ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (1-2 days)

- Lock all critical SSOT files
- Create backups for unlocked files
- Fix corrupted files

### Phase 2: Short-term (1-2 weeks)

- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Fix missing dependencies
- Deploy automated backup system

### Phase 3: Medium-term (2-4 weeks)

- Full system validation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Lock System Features

```python
# Example usage of the file lock system
from ssot_file_lock_system_batch2 import SSOTFileLockManager, LockType, LockPriority

# Initialize lock manager
lock_manager = SSOTFileLockManager()

# Acquire write lock
success, lock_id = lock_manager.acquire_lock(
    file_path="/path/to/file",
    lock_type=LockType.WRITE_LOCK,
    owner="user",
    priority=LockPriority.HIGH,
    duration=3600,
    reason="Critical operation"
)

# Release lock
success, message = lock_manager.release_lock(lock_id, "user")
```

### Comprehensive Manager Features

```python
# Example usage of the comprehensive manager
from ssot_comprehensive_manager_batch3 import SSOTComprehensiveManager

# Initialize manager
manager = SSOTComprehensiveManager()

# Safe file operations
success, error, content = manager.safe_read_file("/path/to/file", "user")
success, error = manager.safe_write_file("/path/to/file", content, "user")

# System health check
health = manager.get_system_health()
print(f"Health: {health.overall_health.value} ({health.health_score:.2f})")
```

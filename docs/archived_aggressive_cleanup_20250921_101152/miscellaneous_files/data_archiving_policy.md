# Project Nexus Data Archiving and Lifecycle Management Policy

This document defines the policies and procedures for data archiving, retention, and lifecycle management within Project Nexus. A clear policy ensures data integrity, compliance with regulations, optimized storage, and efficient data retrieval when needed.

## 1. Principles

- **Compliance:** Adhere to all relevant legal, regulatory, and internal compliance requirements for data retention.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure archived data remains accurate, complete, and unalterable.
- **Accessibility:** Archived data must be retrievable within defined service level objectives (SLOs).
- **Cost Optimization:** Manage storage costs by moving less frequently accessed data to more cost-effective storage tiers.
- **Security:** Protect archived data with appropriate security measures (encryption, access controls).

## 2. Data Classification

All data within Project Nexus should be classified based on its sensitivity, business criticality, and retention requirements. Examples:

- **Critical Operational Data:** (e.g., transaction records, user profiles) - High retention, high security.
- **Historical Analytical Data:** (e.g., past usage logs, aggregated metrics) - Medium retention, medium security.
- **Temporary/Ephemeral Data:** (e.g., session data, temporary caches) - Low retention, can be purged quickly.

## 3. Archiving Triggers and Criteria

Data will be moved from active operational databases to archive storage based on defined criteria:

- **Age-based:** Data older than [X] days/months/years.
- **Status-based:** Data associated with completed, cancelled, or inactive entities.
- **Size-based:** Large datasets exceeding a certain threshold.

## 4. Archiving Process

### 4.1 Identification

- Regularly identify data eligible for archiving based on classification and triggers.

### 4.2 Extraction

- Extract data from active databases using [Specify tools/methods, e.g., ETL jobs, database replication, custom scripts].
- Ensure data consistency during extraction (e.g., transactional integrity).

### 4.3 Transformation (Optional)

- Data may be transformed (e.g., aggregated, anonymized, compressed) before storage to optimize for archive storage and future analytical use.

### 4.4 Storage

- **Archive Location:** [Specify archive storage, e.g., S3 Glacier, Google Cloud Storage Coldline, dedicated archive database].
- **Format:** Store data in a format suitable for long-term retention and retrieval (e.g., Parquet, CSV, JSON, database backups).
- **Encryption:** All archived data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

### 4.5 Verification

- Verify the integrity and completeness of archived data after storage.

## 5. Data Retention Periods

| Data Type/Classification     | Retention Period | Justification (e.g., Legal, Business) |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| [Example: User Transactions] | 7 years          | Financial Regulations                 |
| [Example: Access Logs]       | 1 year           | Security Audits                       |
| [Example: Old User Data]     | 5 years          | Customer Service, Legal               |

## 6. Data Retrieval

- **Process:** Define the process for retrieving archived data, including who can request it, approval workflows, and expected retrieval times.
- **Tools:** [Specify tools/methods for retrieval, e.g., dedicated query interfaces, data lakes, restore procedures].

## 7. Data Purging/Deletion

- **Policy:** Data that has exceeded its retention period will be securely purged/deleted from all storage locations.
- **Method:** [Specify secure deletion methods, e.g., cryptographic erasure, physical destruction for hardware].

## 8. Monitoring and Auditing

- Monitor archiving processes for failures or anomalies.
- Regularly audit archived data for compliance and integrity.

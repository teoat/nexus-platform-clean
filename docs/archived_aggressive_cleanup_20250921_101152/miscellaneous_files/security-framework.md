# Security Framework

## Financial Examiner POV System Security Architecture

### Overview

The security framework ensures data protection, access control, and compliance with financial industry standards for the Financial Examiner POV system.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Primary**: Username/password with strong password requirements
- **Secondary**: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via authenticator apps
- **Backup**: SMS-based verification for account recovery
- **Hardware**: FIDO2/WebAuthn support for high-security environments

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```yaml
roles:
  financial_examiner:
    permissions:
      - read:financial_data
      - write:financial_data
      - read:reports
      - write:reports
      - switch_pov:all

  prosecutor:
    permissions:
      - read:financial_data
      - read:fraud_flags
      - write:litigation_cases
      - read:evidence
      - write:evidence
      - switch_pov:prosecutor

  judge:
    permissions:
      - read:litigation_cases
      - read:evidence
      - read:reports

      - switch_pov:judge

  executive:
    permissions:
      - read:financial_summaries
      - read:risk_assessments
      - read:executive_reports
      - switch_pov:executive

  compliance_officer:
    permissions:
      - read:compliance_reports
      - write:compliance_audits
      - read:audit_logs
      - switch_pov:compliance_officer

  auditor:
    permissions:
      - read:all_data
      - write:audit_reports
      - read:audit_trails
      - switch_pov:auditor
```

### JWT Token Management

```json
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "RS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  },
  "payload": {
    "sub": "user_uuid",
    "role": "prosecutor",
    "pov_role": "prosecutor",
    "permissions": ["read:evidence", "write:cases"],
    "exp": 1642521600,
    "iat": 1642518000,
    "iss": "nexus-platform"
  }
}
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

- **At Rest**: AES-256-GCM for database encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault
- **File Storage**: Encrypted S3 buckets with server-side encryption

### Data Classification

```yaml
classification_levels:
  public:
    description: "Non-sensitive information"
    encryption: "Standard TLS"
    retention: "1 year"

  internal:
    description: "Internal business data"
    encryption: "AES-256"
    retention: "7 years"

  confidential:
    description: "Financial and legal data"
    encryption: "AES-256 + additional controls"
    retention: "10 years"

  restricted:
    description: "Highly sensitive legal evidence"
    encryption: "AES-256 + hardware security modules"
    retention: "Permanent"
```

### PII Protection

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary personal information
- **Anonymization**: Remove PII from analytics and reporting
- **Pseudonymization**: Replace direct identifiers with pseudonyms
- **Right to Erasure**: Implement data deletion upon request

## Network Security

### Network Architecture

```
Internet
    â†“
[Load Balancer] (TLS Termination)
    â†“
[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]
    â†“
[API Gateway] (Rate Limiting, Authentication)
    â†“
[Application Servers] (Internal Network)
    â†“
[Database Cluster] (Private Subnet)
```

### Security Controls

- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive inbound/outbound rules
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate different system components
- **DDoS Protection**: CloudFlare or AWS Shield
- **VPN Access**: Site-to-site VPN for administrative access
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Application Security

### Input Validation

```python
# Example input validation
def validate_financial_data(data):
    schema = {
        "amount": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 999999.99},
        "date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"},
        "description": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 500},
        "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["office", "travel", "meals"]}
    }
    return validate(data, schema)
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

- **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Least Privilege**: Database users with minimal required permissions
- **Query Monitoring**: Log and monitor all database queries

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

- **Output Encoding**: Encode all user-generated content
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrict resource loading
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Prevent client-side script access

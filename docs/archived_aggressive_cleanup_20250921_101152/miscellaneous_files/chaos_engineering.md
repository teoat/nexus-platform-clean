# Project Nexus Chaos Engineering Guidelines

This document outlines the principles and practices for implementing Chaos Engineering within Project Nexus. Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in that system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.

## 1. Principles

- **Hypothesize about steady-state behavior:** Define what normal operation looks like.
- **Vary real-world events:** Introduce failures that mimic real-world scenarios (e.g., network latency, service outages, resource exhaustion).
- **Run experiments in production:** The most accurate results come from experiments on the actual production system.
- **Automate experiments:** Automate the execution and analysis of chaos experiments.
- **Minimize blast radius:** Design experiments to limit the impact of potential failures.

## 2. Goals of Chaos Engineering

- Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system before they cause outages.
- Improve system resilience and fault tolerance.
- Build confidence in the system's ability to handle failures.
- Validate monitoring and alerting systems.
- Improve incident response procedures.

## 3. Types of Experiments

- **Resource Exhaustion:** Injecting CPU, memory, disk I/O, or network saturation.
- **Service Failure:** Shutting down or restarting microservices, databases, or other dependencies.
- **Network Latency/Partition:** Introducing delays or blocking network traffic between services.
- **Time Skew:** Manipulating system clocks.
- **Dependency Failure:** Simulating failures of external APIs or third-party services.

## 4. Chaos Experiment Process

1.  **Define Steady State:** Establish a baseline of normal system behavior (e.g., latency, error rates, throughput) using monitoring tools.
2.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Propose how the system will behave under a specific fault condition (e.g., "If the Authentication Service fails, users will experience a temporary login error, but existing sessions will remain active.").
3.  **Design Experiment:** Choose the fault to inject, the target (e.g., a specific microservice, a percentage of traffic), the duration, and the metrics to observe.
4.  **Minimize Blast Radius:** Start with small, controlled experiments (e.g., in a staging environment, or with a small percentage of production traffic).
5.  **Execute Experiment:** Inject the chosen fault into the system.
6.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Observe the system's behavior and compare it against the hypothesis. Did the system behave as expected? Did alerts fire correctly?
7.  **Automate Cleanup:** Ensure the system returns to its steady state after the experiment.
8.  **Document Findings:** Record the results, lessons learned, and any identified weaknesses. Create tasks to address these weaknesses.

## 5. Tools for Chaos Engineering

- **Chaos Mesh:** Cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform for Kubernetes.
- **Gremlin:** SaaS platform for Chaos Engineering.
- **Chaos Toolkit:** Open-source toolkit for defining and running chaos experiments.
- **Netflix's Chaos Monkey:** Randomly terminates instances in production.

## 6. Integration with CI/CD

- Consider integrating automated, small-scale chaos experiments into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously test resilience.

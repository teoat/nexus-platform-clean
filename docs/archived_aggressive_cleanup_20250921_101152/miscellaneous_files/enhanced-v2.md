    max_concurrent_tasks: int = 10          # Concurrent task limit
    task_timeout: int = 300                 # Dynamic: 120-600s based on completion rate
    worker_idle_threshold: int = 30         # Idle worker detection
    fallback_help_threshold: int = 60       # Fallback help trigger
    performance_optimization_interval: int = 30  # Optimization frequency
    auto_scaling_aggressiveness: float = 1.5    # 2x scaling multiplier

# Project Nexus Performance Profiling and Benchmarking Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for performance profiling and benchmarking within Project Nexus. Regular profiling and benchmarking are essential to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and ensure the application meets its performance requirements.

## 1. Principles

- **Measure, Don't Guess:** Always base optimization efforts on actual performance data.
- **Focus on Bottlenecks:** Prioritize optimizing the slowest or most resource-intensive parts of the system.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure benchmarks are consistent and reproducible.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Integrate performance monitoring into CI/CD and production environments.

## 2. Performance Profiling

### 2.1 What is Profiling?

Profiling is the process of analyzing the execution of a program to measure its performance characteristics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and function call times.

### 2.2 When to Profile?

- When a performance issue is suspected or reported.
- Before and after implementing significant changes.
- Periodically as part of maintenance.

### 2.3 Profiling Tools

- **Backend (Python):**
  - `cProfile`/`profile`: Built-in Python profilers.
  - `snakeviz`: Visualizer for `cProfile` output.
  - `memory_profiler`: For line-by-line memory usage.
  - `py-spy`: Sampling profiler for Python programs.
- **Frontend (JavaScript):**
  - Browser Developer Tools (Performance tab, Memory tab).
  - Lighthouse (for web vitals and best practices).
- **System-level:**
  - `htop`, `top`, `dstat`: For CPU, memory, disk I/O, network usage.
  - `perf`: Linux performance analysis tool.

### 2.4 Profiling Process

1.  **Identify Target:** Determine the specific code path, API endpoint, or user journey to profile.
2.  **Run Profiler:** Execute the application with the chosen profiler enabled.
3.  **Analyze Results:** Examine the profiler output (e.g., call graphs, flame graphs) to pinpoint hot spots (functions consuming most time/resources).
4.  **Optimize:** Implement changes to address the identified bottlenecks.
5.  **Re-profile:** Verify the impact of optimizations.

## 3. Performance Benchmarking

### 3.1 What is Benchmarking?

Benchmarking is the process of running a set of predefined tests to measure the performance of a system or component under specific conditions, often to compare against a baseline or a target.

### 3.2 When to Benchmark?

- To establish performance baselines.
- To validate performance requirements (e.g., response time, throughput).
- To compare different implementations or configurations.
- To perform load testing and stress testing.

### 3.3 Benchmarking Tools

- **API/Backend Load Testing:**
  - Locust (Python-based, code-driven load tests).
  - JMeter (Java-based, comprehensive load testing).
  - k6 (JavaScript-based, developer-centric load testing).
  - ApacheBench (`ab`): Simple HTTP benchmarking tool.
- **Frontend Performance:**
  - Lighthouse CI (for automated performance audits in CI).
  - WebPageTest.

### 3.4 Benchmarking Process

1.  **Define Metrics:** Clearly define what metrics will be measured (e.g., average response time, p95 latency, requests per second, error rate).
2.  **Establish Baseline:** Run benchmarks on a known good version of the system to establish a baseline.
3.  **Design Test Scenarios:** Create realistic test scenarios that simulate expected user behavior and load patterns.
4.  **Execute Benchmarks:** Run the benchmarks in a controlled environment.
5.  **Analyze and Report:** Compare results against baselines and targets. Generate reports.
6.  **Iterate:** Optimize and re-benchmark until performance goals are met.

## 4. Integration with CI/CD

- Automate performance tests (e.g., Lighthouse CI, basic load tests) within the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early.
- Store benchmark results for historical comparison.

# Identity Verification System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing an identity verification system for the NEXUS platform, as part of the Zero-Trust Architecture.

## 1. Proposed Solution

I propose a solution based on the following components:

- **API Gateway:** To act as a single entry point for all client requests and to handle authentication.
- **Centralized Identity Provider (IdP):** To manage user identities, roles, and permissions.
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC):** As the protocols for authorization and authentication.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):** To transmit identity information between services in a stateless and secure manner.

## 2. Technology Choices

- **API Gateway:** The `master_todo.md` file mentions **Kong** as the API gateway. I will proceed with this choice.
- **Identity Provider (IdP):** I propose using **Keycloak**, an open-source identity and access management solution. It's powerful, flexible, and can be self-hosted, which is a good starting point for the NEXUS platform.
- **JWT Library:** I will use the **PyJWT** library in Python for handling JWTs.

## 3. Implementation Steps

I will implement the identity verification system in the following steps:

1.  **Set up Keycloak:** I will install and configure Keycloak as the central IdP. This will involve creating a new realm for the NEXUS platform and configuring clients for the different applications.
2.  **Configure Kong:** I will configure Kong to act as an OAuth 2.0 resource server and to validate the JWTs issued by Keycloak.
3.  **Create an Authentication Service:** I will create a new Python service that will be responsible for:
    - User registration and login.
    - Interacting with Keycloak to obtain JWTs for users.
4.  **Modify Microservices:** I will modify the existing microservices to:
    - Expect a JWT in the `Authorization` header of incoming requests.
    - Validate the JWT and extract the user's identity and permissions.
    - Enforce access control based on the user's permissions.
5.  **Testing:** I will write unit and integration tests to ensure that the entire authentication and authorization flow is working correctly.

## 4. Next Steps

I will start by setting up Keycloak. I will use Docker to run Keycloak locally for development and testing purposes. I will create a `docker-compose.yml` file for this.

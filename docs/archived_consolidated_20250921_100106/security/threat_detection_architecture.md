# Advanced Threat Detection System Architecture (OpenThreat AI - Conceptual)

This document outlines a conceptual architecture for an open-source AI-powered threat detection engine for the NEXUS platform, based on the principles of Zero-Trust and leveraging existing infrastructure.

## 1. Core Objective

Detect anomalous user behavior, network intrusions, and data exfiltration attempts in near real-time using AI/ML models.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1. Data Ingestion Layer

- **Logstash:** Primary data collector for network logs, system logs, endpoint telemetry, application logs, and user activity logs. It will parse, filter, and enrich data before forwarding.

### 2.2. Data Storage & Indexing Layer

- **Elasticsearch:** Central repository for all ingested and processed security event data, providing indexing, search, and aggregation capabilities.

### 2.3. Threat Detection Microservices (Python)

- A suite of independent Python microservices, each for a specific detection domain (e.g., User Behavior Analytics, Network Anomaly Detection, Data Exfiltration Monitoring).
- **Data Consumption:** Microservices will consume data from Elasticsearch (via scheduled queries or real-time streams).
- **AI/ML Models:** Each microservice will host and execute trained AI/ML models (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) to identify anomalies.
- **Alert Generation:** Upon detecting a potential threat, microservices will generate structured security alerts/events and push them back into Elasticsearch (or a dedicated alerting queue).

### 2.4. Monitoring & Observability Layer

- **Prometheus:** For collecting metrics from all components (Kubernetes nodes, Docker containers, Python microservices, ELK stack).
- **Jaeger:** For distributed tracing across Python microservices.

### 2.5. Orchestration & Deployment Layer

- **Docker:** All components will be containerized.
- **Kubernetes:** The entire system will be deployed and managed on Kubernetes for scalability, high availability, resource management, and service discovery.

### 2.6. Visualization & Alerting Layer

- **Kibana:** Provides dashboards for security analysts to visualize security events, explore logs, monitor detection rates, and manage alerts. Kibana's alerting features will trigger notifications.

## 3. Key Considerations

- **Data Volume:** Design for massive volumes of security log data.
- **Real-time vs. Batch:** Determine processing requirements for different detections.
- **Model Training & Management:** Implement MLOps practices for training, updating, and deploying AI/ML models.
- **False Positives/Negatives:** Continuous tuning to minimize false alerts and maximize accuracy.
- **Security:** Secure communication, access control, and data encryption between all components.

## 4. Next Steps (Implementation of 1.1.2 Sub-tasks)

I will now proceed with outlining the implementation plan for each sub-task of "1.1.2 Advanced Threat Detection System" based on this architecture.

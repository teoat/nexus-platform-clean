# Zero-Trust Security Model Design

This document outlines a proposed design for a Zero-Trust security model for the NEXUS platform, based on industry best practices.

## 1. Core Principles

The Zero-Trust model is founded on three core principles:

- **Verify Explicitly:** Every access request is treated as originating from an untrusted network. We will authenticate and authorize every request based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, and data classification.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Users and systems will be granted only the minimum necessary access rights to perform their tasks (just-in-time and just-enough access). Privileges will be regularly reviewed and adjusted.
- **Assume Breach:** The security posture will be designed with the assumption that attackers are already present both inside and outside the network. The goal is to minimize the "blast radius" of a breach.

## 2. Key Implementation Steps

I will implement the Zero-Trust model in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Foundational Elements

1.  **Define the Protect Surface:** I will start by identifying and prioritizing the most critical assets, data, applications, and services that need protection within the NEXUS platform.
2.  **Map Transaction Flows:** I will analyze how traffic moves to and from these sensitive assets to identify potential vulnerabilities and inform the microsegmentation strategy.
3.  **Strong Identity and Access Management (IAM):** I will implement a robust authentication and authorization system, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), for all users and services.

### Phase 2: Network and Device Security

4.  **Microsegmentation:** I will divide the network into smaller, isolated segments to enforce strict access controls and limit lateral movement of threats.
5.  **Device Access Control and Integrity:** I will implement a system to verify the identity and security posture of all devices attempting to access resources.

### Phase 3: Continuous Security

6.  **Continuous Monitoring and Analytics:** I will implement comprehensive security monitoring to detect unusual behavior, analyze logs, and automate incident response in real-time.
7.  **Encrypt Data:** I will ensure that all data is encrypted, both at rest and in transit.
8.  **Automated Security Policies:** I will implement automated security rules and responses to enforce policies dynamically.

## 3. Phased Implementation

Implementing a Zero-Trust architecture is a significant undertaking. I will follow a phased approach to ensure a smooth and successful transition. I will start with the most critical services and applications and gradually expand the Zero-Trust umbrella to cover the entire NEXUS platform.

I will begin with the first sub-task: **1.1.1.2 Implement identity verification system**.

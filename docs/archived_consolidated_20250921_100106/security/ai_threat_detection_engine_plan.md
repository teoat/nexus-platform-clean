# AI-Powered Threat Detection Engine Deployment Plan

This document outlines the plan for deploying an AI-powered threat detection engine for the NEXUS platform, focusing on anomaly detection.

## 1. Proposed Libraries

I propose using the following open-source Python libraries:

- **PyOD (Python Outlier Detection):** As the primary library for general anomaly detection, offering a wide range of algorithms.
- **Alibi-detect:** For specific outlier, adversarial, and drift detection relevant to threat scenarios.
- **scikit-learn:** For simpler, well-understood anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest, serving as a baseline.
- **Telemanom:** For time-series anomaly detection, particularly for logs and metrics from ELK and Prometheus.

## 2. Data Integration

The `threat_detection_service` microservice will consume data from Elasticsearch. Data will be queried and fed into the anomaly detection models. For real-time scenarios, streaming data from Logstash/Kafka to the microservice will be considered.

## 3. Microservice Development (`threat_detection_service`)

I will create a new Python microservice named `threat_detection_service`. This service will:

- Connect to Elasticsearch to retrieve relevant security event data.
- Load and apply chosen anomaly detection models (from PyOD, Alibi-detect, scikit-learn, or Telemanom).
- Generate structured security alerts/events for detected anomalies and push them back into Elasticsearch or a dedicated alerting queue.

## 4. Model Training and Management

Initially, I will use pre-trained models or simple unsupervised methods for anomaly detection. In later phases, I will explore training custom models on historical data stored in Elasticsearch, following MLOps practices.

## 5. Deployment

The `threat_detection_service` will be containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes, leveraging the existing orchestration layer.

## 6. Next Steps

I will start by creating the basic structure for the `threat_detection_service` microservice. This will include:

- Creating a new directory `threat_detection_service`.
- Creating a `main.py` file with a basic Flask application.
- Creating a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary libraries (Flask, elasticsearch, pyod, alibi-detect, scikit-learn, telemanom).

I will then proceed to implement the Elasticsearch connection and a basic anomaly detection endpoint.

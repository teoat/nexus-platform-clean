# Device Trust Validation Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing device trust validation as part of the Zero-Trust Architecture for the NEXUS platform.

## 1. Proposed Solution

I propose a solution based on client certificates to establish device identity and trust. This approach will be integrated into the existing authentication flow.

## 2. Key Components

- **Device Registration:** A process for registering devices and issuing them a unique client certificate.
- **Authentication Service:** The authentication service will be updated to validate the client certificate during the authentication process.
- **API Gateway (Kong):** Kong will be configured to require a valid client certificate for all incoming requests to protected services.

## 3. Implementation Steps

1.  **Certificate Authority (CA):** I will set up a simple Certificate Authority (CA) to issue client certificates. For development purposes, I can use a self-signed CA.
2.  **Device Registration Endpoint:** I will create a new endpoint in the `auth_service` that will handle device registration. This endpoint will:
    - Require user authentication.
    - Generate a private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the device.
    - Use the CA to sign the CSR and generate a client certificate.
    - Securely return the client certificate and private key to the device.
3.  **Authentication Service Update:** I will update the `auth_service` to:
    - Validate the client certificate presented by the device during the login process.
    - Include device information in the JWT issued to the user.
4.  **Kong Configuration Update:** I will update the Kong configuration to:
    - Enable TLS client authentication on the routes for protected services.
    - Configure Kong to trust the CA used to issue the client certificates.
5.  **Testing:** I will write tests to ensure that:
    - Only devices with a valid client certificate can register.
    - Only registered devices can authenticate.
    - Requests to protected services without a valid client certificate are rejected by Kong.

## 4. Next Steps

I will start by setting up a simple Certificate Authority (CA) using OpenSSL. I will create a script to automate the process of creating the CA and issuing client certificates.

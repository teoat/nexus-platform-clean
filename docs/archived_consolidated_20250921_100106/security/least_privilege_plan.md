# Least Privilege Access Controls Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing least privilege access controls as part of the Zero-Trust Architecture for the NEXUS platform.

## 1. Proposed Solution

I propose a solution based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Keycloak. This will allow us to define granular permissions for users and services and enforce them at the API gateway and application level.

## 2. Key Components

- **Keycloak:** To define roles and permissions.
- **Kong (API Gateway):** To enforce access control policies at the API gateway level.
- **Microservices:** To enforce access control policies at the application level.

## 3. Implementation Steps

1.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** I will start by defining a set of roles and permissions for the NEXUS platform. These roles will be based on the principle of least privilege.
2.  **Configure Keycloak:** I will configure Keycloak to use the defined roles and permissions. I will create roles in Keycloak and assign them to users.
3.  **Configure Kong:** I will configure Kong to enforce access control policies based on the roles and permissions defined in Keycloak. I will use a JWT-based plugin in Kong to validate the JWTs issued by Keycloak and to check the user's roles and permissions.
4.  **Modify Microservices:** I will modify the microservices to enforce access control policies at the application level. The microservices will validate the JWT and check the user's roles and permissions before allowing access to resources.
5.  **Testing:** I will write tests to ensure that the access control policies are working correctly.

## 4. Phased Implementation

I will follow a phased implementation approach, starting with the most critical services:

- **Phase 1:** Implement RBAC for the `auth_service`.
- **Phase 2:** Implement RBAC for the other microservices.

## 5. Next Steps

I will start by defining the roles and permissions for the NEXUS platform. I will create a new markdown file called `roles_and_permissions.md` to document the roles and permissions.

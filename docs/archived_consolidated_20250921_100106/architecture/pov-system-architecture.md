# POV System Architecture

## Role-Based Perspectives

The POV system provides different views based on user roles:

### Prosecutor Perspective

- Case building tools
- Evidence chain of custody
- Legal document management

### Judge Perspective

- Judicial review tools
- Decision support systems
- Case law references
- Sentencing guidelines

### Executive Perspective

- Strategic oversight
- High-level reporting
- Risk assessment
- Decision making support

### Compliance Officer Perspective

- Regulatory compliance monitoring
- Audit trail verification
- Policy enforcement
- Risk management

### Auditor Perspective

- Audit trail analysis
- Verification tools
- Evidence validation
- Compliance reporting

## POV Switching Logic

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains current task context
- **Role Permissions**: Enforces role-based access control
- **Data Filtering**: Shows only relevant data for each role
- **Interface Adaptation**: Adjusts UI elements for each role

## Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Centralized state for POV switching
- **Component Rendering**: Dynamic component rendering based on role
- **Data Access Control**: Role-based data access restrictions
- **UI Adaptation**: Dynamic UI changes based on current POV

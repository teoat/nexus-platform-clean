# NEXUS SIEM Correlation Rules and Alerts Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for developing correlation rules and configuring alerts within the NEXUS Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. Effective correlation and alerting are crucial for transforming raw log data into actionable security intelligence, enabling rapid detection and response to threats.

## 2. Objectives

- **Reduce Noise:** Minimize false positives by correlating multiple events to identify true security incidents.
- **Prioritize Threats:** Focus security team attention on high-severity and high-confidence alerts.
- **Automate Detection:** Automatically identify known attack patterns, policy violations, and anomalous behavior.
- **Enable Rapid Response:** Provide timely and contextual alerts to facilitate quick incident response.
- **Compliance:** Support compliance requirements for security event monitoring and alerting.

## 3. Key Concepts

- **Correlation Rule:** A set of conditions that, when met by incoming log events, trigger an alert. Rules can involve single events, sequences of events, or aggregations over time.
- **Alert:** A notification generated when a correlation rule is triggered, indicating a potential security incident.
- **Use Case:** A specific threat scenario or security objective that a set of correlation rules aims to detect.

## 4. Correlation Rule Development Strategy

We will adopt a use-case driven approach to correlation rule development, prioritizing rules based on the criticality of the assets and the likelihood/impact of the threats.

### 4.1 Initial High-Priority Use Cases

1.  **Failed Login Attempts (Brute Force/Credential Stuffing):**
    - **Rule:** Multiple failed login attempts from a single source IP or against a single user account within a short time frame (e.g., 5 failed logins in 60 seconds).
    - **Sources:** Keycloak logs, application authentication logs, VPN logs.
    - **Severity:** High.
2.  **Privileged Account Activity:**
    - **Rule:** Any login or activity by a privileged account (e.g., Administrator, root) outside of defined working hours or from unusual locations.
    - **Sources:** Keycloak logs, PAM logs, OS logs.
    - **Severity:** Critical.
3.  **Device Trust Policy Violation:**
    - **Rule:** A 'Low Trust' device attempting to access sensitive data or production resources (correlated with device trust attributes from Keycloak).
    - **Sources:** Keycloak logs, EDR/MDM logs.
    - **Severity:** Critical.
4.  **Network Segmentation Violation:**
    - **Rule:** Communication attempts between network segments that are explicitly denied by firewall rules or network policies.
    - **Sources:** Firewall logs, service mesh logs, Kubernetes Network Policy logs.
    - **Severity:** High.
5.  **Malware/Threat Detection:**
    - **Rule:** EDR/Antivirus solution reports malware detection or suspicious process activity.
    - **Sources:** EDR logs, HIDS logs.
    - **Severity:** Critical.

### 4.2 Rule Refinement

- **Baseline Establishment:** For behavioral rules, establish baselines of normal activity to reduce false positives.
- **Tuning:** Continuously tune rules based on feedback from security operations to improve accuracy and reduce alert fatigue.
- **Context Enrichment:** Enrich alerts with additional context (e.g., user details, device information, threat intelligence) to aid investigation.

## 5. Alerting Configuration Strategy

- **Severity Levels:** Alerts will be categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) to guide response priority.
- **Notification Channels:** Configure various notification channels based on alert severity:
  - **Critical/High:** PagerDuty/Opsgenie (on-call rotation), Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard, email, Slack/Teams channel.
  - **Medium:** SOC dashboard, email, Slack/Teams channel.
  - **Low:** SOC dashboard, daily/weekly summary reports.
- **Escalation Policies:** Define clear escalation paths for unacknowledged or unresolved critical alerts.
- **Runbook Integration:** Link alerts to relevant incident response runbooks for immediate guidance.

## 6. Implementation Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Use Case Prioritization:** Finalize the initial set of high-priority security use cases for detection.
2.  **Phase 2: Rule Development:** Develop correlation rules in the SIEM for each prioritized use case.
3.  **Phase 3: Alert Configuration:** Configure alerts with appropriate severity levels, notification channels, and escalation policies.
4.  **Phase 4: Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test each rule and alert to ensure it triggers correctly and provides actionable information.
5.  **Phase 5: Baseline and Tuning:** Establish baselines for behavioral rules and continuously tune rules to minimize false positives.

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Define Specific Alert Thresholds:** For each rule, specify the exact thresholds that will trigger an alert.
2.  **Integrate with Incident Management System:** Ensure alerts can automatically create incidents in our chosen incident management system.

This document will be updated as correlation rules and alerting capabilities evolve.

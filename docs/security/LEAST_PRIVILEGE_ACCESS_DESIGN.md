# NEXUS Least Privilege Access Controls Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for implementing least privilege access controls within the NEXUS Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA). The principle of least privilege dictates that users, applications, and systems should only be granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their authorized functions.

## 2. Principles of Least Privilege

Our least privilege access control strategy will adhere to the following principles:

- **Default Deny:** All access is denied by default, and explicit permissions must be granted.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access will be managed through roles, where each role has a defined set of permissions.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** For more dynamic and fine-grained control, attributes of the user, resource, and environment will be considered.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:** Temporary elevation of privileges for specific tasks, automatically revoked after completion.
- **Separation of Duties (SoD):** Critical tasks will require multiple individuals to prevent fraud or error.
- **Regular Review:** Access privileges will be regularly reviewed and adjusted as roles and responsibilities change.

## 3. Architecture Components

The NEXUS Least Privilege Access Control system will involve the following components:

- **Keycloak (IAM):** Keycloak will be the central authority for managing user identities, roles, and permissions. It will enforce RBAC and potentially ABAC policies.
- **Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs):** These are components (e.g., API Gateways, microservices, database proxies) that enforce access policies by querying Keycloak or evaluating local policies.
- **Policy Decision Points (PDPs):** Keycloak acts as a PDP, making decisions based on defined policies and attributes.
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM) Solution:** For managing and monitoring privileged accounts (e.g., administrators, service accounts), providing JIT access and session recording.
- **Cloud-Native IAM (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD):** For cloud resources, native IAM solutions will be configured to align with our least privilege principles.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Define Roles and Permissions:** Identify all user roles within NEXUS and define the minimum necessary permissions for each role across all systems and applications.
2.  **Phase 2: Implement RBAC in Keycloak:** Configure roles and assign permissions within Keycloak. Migrate existing users to the new role structure.
3.  **Phase 3: Integrate PAM Solution:** Deploy and integrate a PAM solution for managing privileged accounts, enabling JIT access and session monitoring.
4.  **Phase 4: Enforce Policies at PEPs:** Configure API Gateways, microservices, and other PEPs to enforce Keycloak-driven access policies.
5.  **Phase 5: Implement ABAC (Future):** Explore and implement ABAC for more dynamic and fine-grained access control based on attributes.
6.  **Phase 6: Regular Access Reviews:** Establish a process for periodic review and attestation of access privileges.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Conduct a comprehensive role analysis:** Map existing user functions to proposed roles and their required permissions.
2.  **Develop a PAM solution selection criteria:** Evaluate PAM solutions based on NEXUS requirements.

This document will be updated as the design and implementation of NEXUS Least Privilege Access Controls progresses.

# NEXUS Red Teaming Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for conducting red teaming exercises against the NEXUS platform. Red teaming is a simulated attack designed to test the effectiveness of our security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and assess the overall security posture from an attacker's perspective within our Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA).

## 2. Objectives

- **Validate Security Controls:** Test the effectiveness of implemented Zero-Trust policies (Identity, Device, Network, Least Privilege).
- **Identify Blind Spots:** Discover unknown vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in our defenses.
- **Assess Detection and Response Capabilities:** Evaluate the security team's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from sophisticated attacks.
- **Improve Security Posture:** Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing the overall security of the NEXUS platform.
- **Train Security Personnel:** Provide real-world experience for the security operations and incident response teams.

## 3. Scope of Red Teaming

Red teaming will target the entire NEXUS platform, including:

- **External Perimeter:** Public-facing applications, APIs, and infrastructure.
- **Internal Network:** Lateral movement within segmented networks.
- **Applications:** Web applications, microservices, APIs.
- **Identity and Access Management:** Keycloak, user accounts, privileged accounts.
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS, Azure, GCP resources.
- **People and Processes:** Social engineering attempts (within defined ethical boundaries).

## 4. Red Teaming Phases

### 4.1 Planning and Reconnaissance

- **Define Rules of Engagement (RoE):** Clearly define the scope, objectives, allowed techniques, and communication protocols with the blue team (defense).
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Red team gathers information about the NEXUS platform (OSINT, passive scanning) to identify potential attack vectors.
- **Threat Modeling:** Develop attack scenarios based on identified threats and vulnerabilities.

### 4.2 Infiltration and Initial Access

- **Exploitation:** Attempt to gain initial access to the NEXUS environment using various techniques (e.g., exploiting known vulnerabilities, phishing, credential stuffing).
- **Bypass Controls:** Test the effectiveness of perimeter defenses, MFA, and device trust controls.

### 4.3 Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation

- **Internal Reconnaissance:** Map the internal network, identify critical assets, and discover additional vulnerabilities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attempt to gain higher levels of access within the compromised environment.
- **Bypass Segmentation:** Test the effectiveness of network segmentation policies.

### 4.4 Persistence and Exfiltration

- **Establish Persistence:** Create mechanisms to maintain access to the compromised systems.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attempt to exfiltrate simulated sensitive data to test data loss prevention controls.

### 4.5 Detection and Response Evaluation

- **Blue Team Engagement:** The blue team (NEXUS security operations) will actively monitor for red team activity.
- **Incident Response Simulation:** Evaluate the blue team's ability to detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from the simulated attack.

## 5. Communication and Reporting

- **Pre-Engagement Briefing:** Detailed briefing with leadership and blue team on RoE and objectives.
- **Regular Check-ins:** Agreed-upon communication channels for urgent notifications (e.g., critical system impact).
- **Post-Engagement Debrief:** Joint session with red and blue teams to discuss findings, lessons learned, and areas for improvement.
- **Final Report:** Comprehensive report detailing attack paths, exploited vulnerabilities, detection gaps, and actionable recommendations.

## 6. Ethical Considerations

- All red teaming activities will be conducted within strict ethical guidelines and agreed-upon Rules of Engagement.
- No actual sensitive data will be exfiltrated.
- Critical production systems will have clear stop-loss conditions to prevent unintended disruption.

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Select Red Teaming Partner:** Engage with a reputable third-party red teaming firm or allocate internal resources.
2.  **Develop Detailed RoE:** Finalize the Rules of Engagement document with all stakeholders.
3.  **Prepare Environment:** Ensure necessary logging and monitoring are in place for blue team visibility.

This document will be updated as the red teaming exercise progresses.

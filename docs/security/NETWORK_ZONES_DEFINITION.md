# NEXUS Network Zones Definition

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the logical network zones for the NEXUS platform, a critical step in implementing network segmentation as part of our Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA). Clear zone definition is essential for establishing precise communication requirements and security policies.

## 2. Principles of Zone Definition

- **Function-Based:** Zones are defined based on the primary function or role of the systems within them.
- **Sensitivity-Based:** Higher sensitivity data or critical systems reside in more restricted zones.
- **Communication Requirements:** Each zone's communication needs with other zones are explicitly defined.
- **Isolation:** Zones are designed to be isolated by default, with explicit rules for inter-zone communication.

## 3. Defined Network Zones

### 3.1 Internet-Facing Zone (DMZ)

- **Purpose:** To host public-facing services that are directly accessible from the internet.
- **Components:** API Gateways, Load Balancers, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), public web servers.
- **Communication Requirements:**
  - **Inbound:** Open to internet for specific ports (e.g., 80, 443).
  - **Outbound:** Limited to necessary backend services (e.g., Application Zone, specific external APIs).
  - **Inter-Zone:** Strictly controlled communication with the Application Zone.
- **Security Considerations:** Highest exposure, requires stringent security controls, DDoS protection, and continuous monitoring.

### 3.2 Application Zone

- **Purpose:** To host the core NEXUS application services and business logic.
- **Components:** Microservices, application servers, message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), caching layers (e.g., Redis).
- **Communication Requirements:**
  - **Inbound:** From DMZ (API Gateway), Management Zone (for deployment/monitoring).
  - **Outbound:** To Database Zone, other Application Zone services, external services (e.g., third-party APIs).
  - **Inter-Zone:** Controlled communication with DMZ, Database Zone, and Management Zone.
- **Security Considerations:** Requires strong internal segmentation (micro-segmentation) and strict access controls to the Database Zone.

### 3.3 Database Zone

- **Purpose:** To host all NEXUS database instances and data storage solutions.
- **Components:** PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis (persistent storage), data lakes (e.g., MinIO/S3).
- **Communication Requirements:**
  - **Inbound:** Strictly from the Application Zone and Management Zone (for backups/administration).
  - **Outbound:** Limited to backup targets, monitoring systems.
  - **Inter-Zone:** Highly restricted communication with the Application Zone.
- **Security Considerations:** Most sensitive zone, requires encryption at rest and in transit, strict access control, and regular auditing.

### 3.4 Management Zone

- **Purpose:** To host tools and services used for managing, monitoring, and deploying the NEXUS platform.
- **Components:** CI/CD servers (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI), monitoring dashboards (e.g., Grafana), logging aggregators (e.g., Kibana), jump servers, configuration management tools.
- **Communication Requirements:**
  - **Inbound:** From trusted administrative networks/VPNs only.
  - **Outbound:** To all other zones for management, deployment, and monitoring purposes.
  - **Inter-Zone:** Controlled communication with all other zones for operational tasks.
- **Security Considerations:** Requires strong authentication (MFA), least privilege access for administrators, and strict network access policies.

### 3.5 Development/Staging Zones

- **Purpose:** To provide isolated environments for development, testing, and staging of new features before production deployment.
- **Components:** Replicas of production services, development tools, test data.
- **Communication Requirements:**
  - **Inbound:** From developer workstations, CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Outbound:** Limited to external development tools or mock services.
  - **Inter-Zone:** Isolated from Production zones. Communication between Dev and Staging zones should be controlled.
- **Security Considerations:** Data sanitization for non-production environments, strict access controls, and no direct access to production resources.

## 4. Communication Matrix (Example)

| Source Zone \ Destination Zone | Internet-Facing | Application | Database | Management | Dev/Staging |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| **Internet-Facing**            | -               | Limited     | No       | No         | No          |
| **Application**                | Limited         | Internal    | Limited  | No         | No          |
| **Database**                   | No              | No          | Internal | No         | No          |
| **Management**                 | Limited         | Limited     | Limited  | Internal   | Limited     |
| **Dev/Staging**                | Limited         | Limited     | Limited  | Limited    | Internal    |

_Note: "Limited" implies specific ports and protocols are allowed; "No" implies no direct communication._

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Implement VLANs/Subnets:** Create the necessary network infrastructure to support these zones.
2.  **Configure Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall policies based on the communication matrix.
3.  **Deploy Service Mesh/Network Policies:** Apply micro-segmentation within zones.

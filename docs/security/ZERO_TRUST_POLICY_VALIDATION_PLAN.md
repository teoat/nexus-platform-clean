# NEXUS Zero-Trust Policy Validation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for testing and validating the implemented Zero-Trust policies within the NEXUS platform. Comprehensive validation is essential to ensure that our security controls are effective, correctly configured, and meet the objectives of our Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA).

## 2. Objectives

- **Verify Policy Enforcement:** Confirm that all defined Zero-Trust policies (Identity, Device, Network, Least Privilege) are correctly enforced.
- **Identify Gaps and Weaknesses:** Discover any misconfigurations, bypasses, or weaknesses in the implemented controls.
- **Ensure Business Continuity:** Validate that security policies do not inadvertently block legitimate business operations.
- **Compliance Assurance:** Provide evidence of policy effectiveness for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Establish a feedback loop for ongoing policy refinement and security posture enhancement.

## 3. Scope of Validation

Validation will cover the following key areas of the Zero-Trust Architecture:

- **Identity Verification:** Strong authentication (MFA, SSO) and identity brokering.
- **Device Trust Validation:** Device compliance checks and access decisions based on trust levels.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolation between network zones and micro-segments, and controlled inter-segment communication.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Privileged Access Management (PAM).
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Effectiveness of logging, alerting, and reporting for security events.

## 4. Validation Methodologies

We will employ a combination of methodologies to thoroughly test and validate our Zero-Trust policies:

### 4.1 Automated Testing

- **Unit Tests:** For individual policy components (e.g., Keycloak custom authenticators, authorization services).
- **Integration Tests:** To verify end-to-end policy enforcement across integrated systems (e.g., user login with MFA, device trust check, access to a microservice).
- **Security Policy Scanners:** Tools to automatically scan configurations (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies, firewall rules) for adherence to security best practices and defined policies.
- **Automated Penetration Testing Tools:** For identifying common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

### 4.2 Manual Testing / Red Teaming

- **Scenario-Based Testing:** Develop specific test scenarios that simulate various legitimate and malicious access attempts (e.g., unmanaged device attempting to access sensitive data, compromised credentials).
- **Role-Based Access Testing:** Verify that users with specific roles can only access resources explicitly permitted by their role.
- **Negative Testing:** Attempt to access resources with insufficient privileges or from untrusted devices, expecting denial.
- **Red Teaming Exercises:** Conduct simulated attacks by an independent team to identify blind spots and test the effectiveness of detection and response mechanisms.

### 4.3 Audit and Review

- **Configuration Audits:** Regularly review configurations of Keycloak, firewalls, service mesh, and PAM for adherence to design and policy.
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze SIEM logs for policy violations, suspicious activities, and unlogged events.
- **Access Reviews:** Periodic review of actual access grants against defined roles and policies (as per `ACCESS_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`).

## 5. Key Test Cases (Examples)

| Test Case ID | Description                                                                                | Expected Outcome                                                        | Related Policy Area(s)                               |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| ZT-001       | User with valid credentials, but from an untrusted device, attempts sensitive data access. | Access Denied, Alert Generated, User Notified.                          | Device Trust, Least Privilege                        |
| ZT-002       | Developer attempts to access production database directly.                                 | Access Denied, Alert Generated.                                         | Network Segmentation, Least Privilege                |
| ZT-003       | Administrator uses JIT access to perform a critical operation.                             | Access Granted for limited time, Session Recorded, Audit Log Generated. | Least Privilege (PAM)                                |
| ZT-004       | Microservice A attempts to communicate with Microservice B on an unauthorized port.        | Communication Blocked, Alert Generated.                                 | Network Segmentation (Service Mesh/Network Policies) |
| ZT-005       | User attempts to bypass MFA during login.                                                  | MFA Challenge Enforced, Login Denied if MFA Fails, Alert Generated.     | Identity Verification                                |

## 6. Reporting and Remediation

- **Test Reports:** Detailed reports for each validation activity, including findings, severity, and recommendations.
- **Defect Tracking:** All identified issues will be logged in a defect tracking system (e.g., Jira) and prioritized for remediation.
- **Post-Mortem Analysis:** For critical findings, conduct a post-mortem to understand root causes and prevent recurrence.

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Develop Detailed Test Scenarios:** Expand on the key test cases to create comprehensive, executable test plans.
2.  **Identify Testing Tools:** Select and configure appropriate automated testing and security scanning tools.
3.  **Schedule Red Teaming:** Plan and execute red teaming exercises to simulate real-world attacks.

This document will be updated as the validation plan evolves.

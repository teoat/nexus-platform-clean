# NEXUS Access Review Process

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the process for conducting regular access reviews within the NEXUS platform. Periodic access reviews are a critical component of maintaining a strong security posture and ensuring compliance with least privilege principles in our Zero-Trust Architecture.

## 2. Objectives

- **Validate Least Privilege:** Confirm that users and systems retain only the minimum necessary access required for their roles.
- **Identify Excessive Privileges:** Detect and remediate any instances of over-privileged accounts.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Meet regulatory and internal compliance requirements for access governance.
- **Enhance Security:** Reduce the risk of unauthorized access and insider threats.
- **Improve Data Accuracy:** Ensure access records are accurate and up-to-date.

## 3. Scope

Access reviews will cover all types of access within the NEXUS platform, including:

- **User Accounts:** Employees, contractors, temporary staff.
- **Service Accounts:** Accounts used by applications and automated processes.
- **Privileged Accounts:** Administrators, root users, database superusers.
- **System Access:** Access to servers, databases, cloud resources, network devices.
- **Application Access:** Access to specific features and data within NEXUS applications.

## 4. Review Cadence

Access reviews will be conducted at the following frequencies:

- **Critical Systems/Privileged Access:** Quarterly (every 3 months).
- **Standard User Access:** Bi-annually (every 6 months).
- **On-Demand:** Triggered by significant events (e.g., organizational restructuring, security incidents, role changes).

## 5. Review Process Steps

### 5.1 Preparation (Security/Compliance Team)

1.  **Identify Review Scope:** Determine which systems, applications, and user groups are part of the current review cycle.
2.  **Extract Access Data:** Generate reports from Keycloak, PAM solution, cloud IAM, and other systems detailing current access assignments (users, roles, permissions).
3.  **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform relevant resource owners, managers, and system administrators about the upcoming review and their responsibilities.

### 5.2 Review and Attestation (Resource Owners/Managers)

1.  **Review Access:** Resource owners/managers will review the extracted access data for their respective teams/systems.
2.  **Validate Necessity:** For each access entry, determine if the access is still necessary and appropriate for the user's/system's current role.
3.  **Attest Access:** Electronically sign-off on the reviewed access, confirming its validity.
4.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Flag any access that is no longer needed, is excessive, or appears suspicious.

### 5.3 Remediation (Security/System Administrators)

1.  **Collect Discrepancies:** Gather all identified discrepancies from the attestation phase.
2.  **Initiate Remediation:** For unnecessary or excessive access, create tickets (e.g., in Jira) to revoke permissions.
3.  **Investigate Suspicious Access:** For suspicious access, initiate a security investigation.
4.  **Track Remediation:** Monitor the progress of access revocation tickets until completion.

### 5.4 Reporting and Audit (Security/Compliance Team)

1.  **Generate Review Report:** Compile a summary report of the access review, including:
    - Scope of the review.
    - Number of accounts reviewed.
    - Number of access discrepancies identified and remediated.
    - Attestation status.
    - Any outstanding issues or risks.
2.  **Archive Records:** Store all review documentation and reports in a secure, auditable location.
3.  **Present Findings:** Share the review findings with relevant management and audit committees.

## 6. Tools and Automation

- **Keycloak:** For managing roles and permissions, and generating user-role mappings.
- **PAM Solution:** For managing privileged access and generating session logs.
- **SIEM:** For collecting and analyzing audit logs related to access changes and attempts.
- **Ticketing System (e.g., Jira):** For tracking remediation tasks.
- **Custom Scripting/Automation:** To automate data extraction, report generation, and notification processes.

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Develop Automation Scripts:** Create scripts to automate the extraction of access data from various systems.
2.  **Integrate with Ticketing System:** Set up automated ticket creation for access revocation requests.
3.  **Train Stakeholders:** Provide training to resource owners and managers on their responsibilities in the access review process.

This document will be updated as the access review process matures.

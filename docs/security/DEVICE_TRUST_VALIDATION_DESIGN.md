# NEXUS Device Trust Validation Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for implementing device trust validation within the NEXUS Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA). Device trust is a critical component of ZTA, ensuring that only trusted and compliant devices are granted access to NEXUS resources.

## 2. Principles of Device Trust

Our device trust validation will be based on the following principles:

- **Continuous Assessment:** Device trust will be continuously assessed, not just at the point of initial access.
- **Policy-Driven:** Device trust policies will be defined and enforced based on security requirements and risk levels.
- **Granular Control:** Access will be granted based on the device's trust level, allowing for granular control over resource access.
- **User Experience:** The device trust validation process should be as seamless as possible for legitimate users.

## 3. Architecture Components

The NEXUS Device Trust Validation system will involve the following components:

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) / Mobile Device Management (MDM):** For managed devices, EDR or MDM solutions will provide real-time information about device health, security posture, and compliance with organizational policies (e.g., OS version, patch level, antivirus status, encryption status).
- **Device Certificates / Hardware Attestation:** For stronger device identity, devices can be issued certificates or leverage hardware-based attestation (e.g., TPM) to cryptographically verify their identity and integrity.
- **Network Access Control (NAC):** NAC solutions can be used to enforce network-level access based on device identity and compliance status.
- **Keycloak (IAM):** Keycloak will integrate with device trust signals to make access decisions. Device trust attributes will be passed to Keycloak during authentication/authorization flows.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Device trust events and compliance data will be logged and monitored in the SIEM for auditing and anomaly detection.

## 4. Device Trust Levels

Devices will be categorized into different trust levels based on their compliance and security posture. Examples include:

- **High Trust:** Managed devices, fully compliant, up-to-date, encrypted, and free of known vulnerabilities.
- **Medium Trust:** Managed devices with minor compliance issues (e.g., outdated software, but still within acceptable limits).
- **Low Trust:** Unmanaged devices, non-compliant, or devices exhibiting suspicious behavior.

Access policies will be tied to these trust levels, allowing high-trust devices more permissive access than low-trust devices.

## 5. Implementation Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Integrate EDR/MDM with IAM:** Establish a mechanism to feed device health and compliance data from EDR/MDM solutions into Keycloak.
2.  **Phase 2: Define Device Trust Policies:** Create granular policies in Keycloak based on device attributes and desired access levels.
3.  **Phase 3: Implement Network Access Control (Optional):** Explore and implement NAC for network-level enforcement if required.
4.  **Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring and Reporting:** Set up dashboards and alerts in SIEM for device trust status and policy violations.

## 6. Future Considerations

- Hardware-based attestation for unmanaged devices.
- Behavioral analysis of device activity to dynamically adjust trust scores.

This document will be updated as the design and implementation of the NEXUS Device Trust Validation progresses.

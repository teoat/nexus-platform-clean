# config/cdn.conf - CDN Configuration Placeholder
# This file serves as a placeholder for CDN (Content Delivery Network) configurations.
# Actual CDN configurations are typically managed within your CDN provider's console (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN).
# This file can be used to document CDN settings or to hold configuration snippets for integration with your application or web server (e.g., Nginx).

# Example: Nginx configuration snippet to serve static assets from CDN
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     server_name your-app.com;

#     location /static/ {
#         # Replace with your CDN domain
#         proxy_pass https://your-cdn-domain.com/static/;
#         # Cache control headers
#         expires 1y;
#         add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
#     }

#     location / {
#         # Proxy to your application backend
#         proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
#         proxy_set_header Host $host;
#         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
#     }
# }
